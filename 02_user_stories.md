## User Stories
"A user story is an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user. Its purpose is to articulate how a software feature will provide value to the customer."
*by MAX REHKOPF Atlassian*

The *User Story* is part of **Agile**, an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and efficient.

My user stories examples:

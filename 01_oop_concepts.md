### What is OOP?
The OOP is the acronymous of **O**bject **O**riented **P**rogramming, a computer programming philosophy that consists of breaking down real-world problems into individual parts called objects. Each object can have certain properties and perform certain actions, that is defined by the nature or type of object. Since the advent of object-oriented programming, many programming languages have emerged to work with this philosophy: Smalltalk (the first one), C, C++, Java, C#. Regarding this topic, there are a large number of trends, variants or opinions regarding the fidelity that each language has with the foundations of the OOP. There are 100% OOP languages like Smalltalk in which everything is object, the primitive values and even classes are objects. There are languages that adopt all the fundamentals of OOP but are not completely OOP like C ++, Java, C#.

JavaScript is a prototype-based dynamic-typing language which can emulate certain aspects of the oop like inheritance and encapsulation.

### What is an Object?
For example, if we wanted to model a dog in the world of programming, we could say that a dog has the following properties: nickname, breed, hair color, height, weight and age; and that he can perform the following actions: bark, jump, run, sleep and eat. So in OOP, my pet Nicky with brown hair, 10kg, 25cm tall, 2-year-old would be an instance of the Dog class.

### What is a Class?
The Objects are defined by **Classes**. A class is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing fields to hold the attributes (data) and implementating actions (methods). In many languages, the class name is used as the name for the class and have a procedure called constructor, has a routine called constructor, which is intended to create an instance of the class, which results in the creation of the object.
